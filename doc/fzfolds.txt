RATIONALE                                                    *fzfolds-rationale*

I don't know about you, but I love stuff like ctags, and I also love fzf. I
love searching through my ctags using fzf. I also love folds, and use them
liberally, especially fold markers, and I often section off parts of a file
using markers, like a lot of markers. But sometimes I need to find a specific
fold, that might be deeply nested. That's where fzfolds come in, it lets you
fuzzy match for folds, and will put you at the starting point of the fold
selected.

REQUIREMENTS                                              *fzfolds-requirements*

fzf.vim is required for this plugin to work. If you aren't familiar with fzf
it's a commandline fuzzy finder, it lets you fuzzy search whatever you want
and it's great. Go check it out!

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                                               *fzfolds-usage*

:Folds                                                                  *:Folds*

Open a fzf popup and search for folds in file. On accept fzfolds will move
you to that folds line number. fzfolds will not open folds for you, just put
you at the line number, unless `g:fzfolds_open = 1`


==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                        *fzfolds-options*

Currently only one option: `g:fzfolds_open`, if set to `1` fzfolds will open
just enough folds to show the fold you selected (`zv`)
