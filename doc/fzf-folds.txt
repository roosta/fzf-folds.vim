RATIONALE                                                  *fzf-folds-rationale*

I don't know about you, but I love stuff like ctags, and I also love fzf. I
love searching through my ctags using fzf. I also love folds, and use them
liberally, especially fold markers, and I often section off parts of a file
using markers, like a lot of markers. But sometimes I need to find a specific
fold, that might be deeply nested. That's where fzf-folds come in, it lets you
fuzzy match for folds, and will put you at the starting point of the fold
selected.

REQUIREMENTS                                            *fzf-folds-requirements*

fzf.vim is required for this plugin to work. If you aren't familiar with fzf
it's a commandline fuzzy finder, it lets you fuzzy search whatever you want
and it's great. Go check it out!

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                                             *fzf-folds-usage*

:Folds                                                                  *:Folds*

Open a fzf popup and search for folds in file. On accept fzf-folds will move
you to that folds line number. fzf-folds will not open folds for you, just put
you at the line number, unless `g:fzf_folds_open = 1`


==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                      *fzf-folds-options*

Currently only one option: `g:fzf_folds_open`, if set to `1` fzf-folds will
open just enough folds to show the fold you selected (`zv`)
